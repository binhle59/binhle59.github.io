# Wedding Website

A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website.  
_See [binhle59.github.io](http://binhle59.github.io/) for a demo. Use invite code `10042022` and `08052022` to RSVP._

# Highlights

1. Slick and fully **responsive** design.
2. **RSVP feature** which directly uploads data to a Google sheet.
3. **Receive email alerts** when someone RSVPs.
4. **Add to Calendar** feature which supports four different calendars.
5. A nice **Youtube video** showing your venue.
6. **Google Map** showing your venue's location.
7. Start and run the website **completely free**. No hosting, backend server, or database required as you can use
   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host and Google sheets (with the help of Google scripts) to store RSVP
   data.
